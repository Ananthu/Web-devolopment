            <p> The quickest way to understand Big Data is to visualize it. Big Data is the billions of call detail records that surround every phone call you make or data message you send. It is the masses and masses of DNA sequencing analyzed to discover biomedical breakthroughs. It is the millions of individual transactions that pass through a retailerâ€™s point of sale platforms every day. And it is the billions of financial transactions that personal, commercial and corporate customers execute through financial services systems. </p>

            <p> Understood? Well, if you need a tighter explanation, this is the generally accepted definition of what Big Data is: it is a broad term for data sets so large or complex that traditional data processing applications are inadequate.</p>

            <p> These data sets grow in size in part because they are increa singly being gathered by cheap and numerous information-sensing devices. Car insurance companies, for example, increasingly use remote sensing devices to monitor driving patterns and adjust insurance premiums accordingly. Healthcare devices can monitor patient status in remarkable granularity. Radio-frequency identification readers track the movement of manufactured items across warehouses or across the globe. And wireless sensor networks pick up everything from weather patterns to the way wine grapes grow. </p>
